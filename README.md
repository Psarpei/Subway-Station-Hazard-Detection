## Project Description ##
Recently there was a nationwide scandal about an incident at Frankfurt Central Station in whicha boy was pushed onto the railroad tracks in front of an arriving train and lost  his life due to its injuries. However, this incident is not the only one of its kind because such accidents occur from time to time at train stations. At the moment there are no security systems to prevent such accidents, and cameras only exist to provide evidence or clarification after an incident has already happened. In this project, we developed a first prototype of a security system which uses the surveillance cameras at subway stations in combination with the latest deep learning computer vision methods and integrates them into an end-to-end system, which can recognize dangerous situations and initiate measures to prevent further consequences.  Furthermore, we present a 3D subway station simulation, developed in Unity3D, which generates entire train station environments and scenes using an advanced algorithm trough a real data-based distribution of persons.  This simulation is then used to generate training data for the deep learning model.
